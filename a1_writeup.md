# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
My initial thoughts about the python programming language are that it is much easier to use than Java. Code such as using print() is much simler than in Java. Python is a really concise language. 


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
Some similarities between Python and Java are that they both have basic coding functions such as loops, while loops, print statements, the ability to do arithmatic, and the ability to ask for user input alongside other functions. The differences are that Java reuires the user to do much more to get the same result as Python's shorter requirements. You also don't need to declare variables in Python, but you do in Java. 


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
