# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

My initial thoughts about the python programming language are that it is very user-intuitive, and much easier to use than Java. It seems to deal a little less with classes and objects (although I might be mistaken). I feel that Pyton follows a similar fotmat to other languages but in a more concise manner. 


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Some similarities between Python and Java are that they both allow for arithematic equations (you can add, subtract, divide, and multiply), the ability to ask for user input, the ability to assign a number/string/number with decimals to a variable, the ability to create loops, and the abilityt to create lists. It seems like you can do anything you can in Java, in Python as well. This was true in the code I did for Scratch, though that was more simplistic. The similarities between Python and HTML is that special indentation is needed. 

Some differences are that, as stated before, Python does not have the same focus on classes and objects. Printing a String only requires the user to type print("whatever you want") instead of System.out.println("watever you want"); . Python doesn't seem to require any special characters to end statements and, in addition, you don't need to declare a variable. Python and HTML are leagues apart -- not only are there no semicolons in Python, there are also no angle brackets present. Scratch used different names for things such as loops than Python. 


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

Some things I learned through this assignment are asserts, how to reverse a string, how to randomly shuffle items in a list, how to make a dictionary, and how to make an f string.
